# Zero USB Storage

Initially meant to be the UI for a "universal boot drive"-project using a Raspberry PI Zero written in Rust with GTK, this project bekame a way to configure and launch Linux USB Gadgets.

## Features

This application allows to configure some USB Gadget modules and launching them using a GUI. For this to work as intended, the PI has to have a display connected. In my case, I use a 5" touchscreen which is barely bigger than the PI itself.
